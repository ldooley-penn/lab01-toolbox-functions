In the code, you can switch between the 3 solutions by uncommenting/commenting out the preprocessor directives at the top. If SMOOTH is defined, it will
render the pulsing flower similar to problem 1. If SHARP is defined, it will render the rotating spikey flower similar to problem 1. If
CUSTOM is defined, it will render a rotating spikey flower with a color changing mini rotating center.

The 3 solutions can be viewed by commenting/uncommenting the preprocessor directives at the top of the Image file.
If SMOOTH is defined, it will render a pulsing flower with lots of petals, like problem 1.
If SHARP is defined, it will render a spikey rotating flower like problem 2.
If CUSTOM is defined, it will render a bigger rotating flower, and a smaller inversely rotating core with pulsing colors, for problem 3.
